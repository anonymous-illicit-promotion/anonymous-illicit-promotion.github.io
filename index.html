            In this paper, we present an extensive study of the promotion of illicit goods 
            and services on Twitter, a popular online social network(OSN).
          </p>
          <p>
            This study is made possible through the design and implementation of multiple 
            novel tools for detecting and analyzing illicit promotion activities as well as 
            their underlying campaigns. As the results, we observe that illicit promotion 
            is prevalent on Twitter, along with noticeable existence on other three popular 
            OSNs including Youtube, Facebook, and TikTok. Particularly, 12 million distinct 
            posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) have been observed on the Twitter platform, 
            which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 categories of 
            illicit goods and services, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. 
            What are also observed are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K 
            distinct instant messaging (IM) accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as 
            next hops of communication, which strongly indicates that the campaigns 
            underpinning PIPs are also of a large scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. 
            On one hand, Twitter is observed to conduct content moderation in a continuous manner
             and almost 80% PIPs will get gradually unpublished within six months since posted. 
             However, in the meantime,  miscreants adopt various evasion tactics to masquerade 
             their PIPs, which renders more than 90% PIPs keeping hidden from the detection 
             radar for two months or longer.

              An overview of the methodology to capture and analyze posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) on Twitter.

          </div>
          <p>
            As illustrated in the figure above, the methodology to fulfill our research is comprised of two key modules. 
            One is <em>the PIP hunter</em>, an automatic pipeline to capture illicit promotion tweets as well as collecting 
            the relevant Twitter accounts. The other is <em>the PIP analyzer</em>, which is designed to profile PIPs with 
            regards to their categories of illicit services and goods, next-hop contacts, and the underlying  campaigns.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The PIP Hunter</li>
            <p>
              the PIP hunter consists of a cycle of four steps. To start, it searches Twitter with PIP-relevant
              keywords, which is followed by a binary PIP classifier that takes a multilingual tweet text as the 
              input and decide whether it is a PIP or not. Given PIPs identified, the third step is to evaluate 
              the quality of existing PIP keywords and exclude ones of a low PIP hit rate. Then, the last step is 
              to generate keywords from newly captured PIPs and append them to the keyword set so as to boost the 
              next round of PIP hunting.
            </p>
            <li>The PIP Analyzer</li>
            <p>
              The PIP analyzer includes a multi-class classifier to reveal what kinds of illicit goods and services 
              have been promoted in PIPs, a PIP contact extractor to retrieve from PIPs the embedded next hops to 
              communicate with illicit promotion operators, and a PIP cluster to group PIPs into clusters and thus 
              help reveal the campaigns underpinning PIPs.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            To train and evaluate the PIP classifiers mentioned above,  a ground truth dataset is collected 
            through an iterative labeling process. Specifically, The labeling process involves two labelers 
            independently annotating samples and resolving conflicts periodically. Also, an iterative process 
            is followed for labeling, involving 1) searching Twitter with PIP-relevant keywords, which gives 
            crawled tweets; 2) labeling a sampled subset of the crawled tweets to update ground-truth; 3) 
            training a weak PIP classifier using the updated ephemeral ground-truth; 4) applying the weak 
            PIP classifier to predict crawled tweets that are unlabeled, identifying both false positive and 
            false negative predictions; and 5) updating ground-truth accordingly. Besides, when a sample is 
            labeled, it is assigned with not only the binary PIP class, but also one of the PIP categories. 
            This iterative process continues until no new PIP categories emerge, each PIP category is well 
            represented in ground-truth and the PIP classifier has achieved a good performance when evaluated 
            on the crawled tweets. Furthermore, inter-rater agreement rate over 90% is achieved across all 
            labeling tasks. Particularly, for 1,000 samples from ground-truth, the agreement rate is 99.8%.
          </p>
          <p>
            To facilitate reproduction of our machine learning models (e.g., the binary PIP classifier and the 
            NER-based contact extractor), the source code for training and testing along with the respective 
            ground truth datasets are avalaible at 
            <a href="https://github.com/anonymous-illicit-promotion/Illicit-Promotion-on-Twitter-anonymous?tab=readme-ov-file">this link</a>. 
            Also, to avoid misuse by miscreants, the whole dataset of PIPs and thier contacts will be provided 
            upon request and background checking. Please contact the authors to request access.
